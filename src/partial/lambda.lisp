  "Applies FN on each element of the lambda list LIST, the result
   returned by FN are accumulated into a new list, which is returned
   from the function. FN is called with two arguments: the type of
   argument and the argument itself. The type can be either: :REQUIRED
   for required arguments, :OPTIONAL for optional arguments, :REST for
   rest arguments, :KEY for keyword arguments, :AUX for auxiliary
   variables, :WHOLE for whole destructuring arguments, :ENVIRONMENT
   for environment arguments or NIL for the lambda-list keywords
   themselves. If FN returns NIL for a particular element, that
   element is not inserted into the resulting lambda
   list. If :DESTRUCTURE is true then lambda-list is parsed as a
   destructuring lambda list, if :ENV is true then &ENVIRONMENT
   parameters are allowed. If a syntax error is encountered in the
   lambda-list (incorrect position of lambda-list keywords) a
   `MALFORMED-LAMBDA-LIST' condition is signaled with a SKIP-WALK
   restart, which simply resumes processing as though the lambda list
   keyword appeared in the correct position. The arguments themselves
   are not checked for correct syntax, it is the responsibility of FN
